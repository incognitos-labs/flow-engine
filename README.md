# Flow Engine

> **A programmable business brain** 

An automation and workflow engine that listens for events, evaluates conditions, and executes actions—bringing the power of distributed workflows to your business logic.

## Overview

Flow Engine enables non-technical users to define business rules in plain language:

> **"When X happens, check Y, then do Z."**

Behind the scenes, the system handles the complexity of event-driven workflows, condition evaluation, action execution, failure retries, and comprehensive logging.

## What This Is

Flow Engine is inspired by and comparable to:

- **GHL** (GoHighLevel) - Marketing automation workflows
- **Zapier** - No-code automation platform
- **Temporal** - Durable execution engine
- **Business Logic Engines** - Rule-based decision systems

## Core Capabilities

### Event Listening
Listen for events from various sources and trigger workflows automatically.

### Condition Evaluation
Evaluate complex conditions before executing actions, ensuring workflows only run when appropriate.

### Action Execution
Execute actions reliably with support for multiple integrations and services.

### Retry on Failure
Automatically retry failed operations with configurable retry strategies and exponential backoff.

### Comprehensive Logging
Log everything for debugging, auditing, and monitoring workflow execution.

## Architecture

Flow Engine is built around the concept of **distributed workflows** and **event-driven systems**, teaching you:

- **Distributed Workflows** - How to orchestrate work across services and systems
- **Event-Driven Systems** - How to build reactive, scalable architectures
- **Determinism vs Side Effects** - Understanding pure logic vs. external actions
- **Mental Model** - Thinking of your system as "a programmable business brain"

## Key Concepts

### Workflows
A workflow is a series of steps that execute in sequence or parallel, triggered by events.

### Events
Events are the triggers that start workflows. They can come from:
- Webhooks
- Scheduled tasks
- Database changes
- API calls
- User actions

### Conditions
Conditions determine whether a workflow should proceed. They can check:
- Data values
- External states
- Previous step results
- Time-based rules

### Actions
Actions are the actual work performed:
- API calls
- Database operations
- Notifications
- Data transformations
- External service integrations

## Getting Started

*Coming soon - installation and setup instructions*

## Example Use Cases

- **Marketing Automation**: When a lead fills out a form, check their score, then send them to the appropriate campaign
- **E-commerce**: When an order is placed, verify inventory, then notify fulfillment and update customer records
- **Customer Support**: When a ticket is created, check priority, then assign to the right team and send notifications
- **Data Processing**: When new data arrives, validate it, transform it, then store it in multiple systems
